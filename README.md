# Brackeys Game Jam 2024
This is my submission for Brackeys Jam 2024! It uses a custom engine made in the JAM!
Thanks to The Cherno for the project template.

# How to setup
First, install python. Next, clone the repo using `git clone --recursive https://github.com/kaitabuchi314/BrackeysJam.git`. Then go into Scripts and click on your OS. 
For Mac, it makes an XCode project, for linux, it makes a Codelite project, and for Windows, a vs2022 project. Note: On Windows or Mac, you can run the Linux script if you use codelite. Then, go into the terminal inside the repo's folder, and run `python SetProject.py` and type "App", then press enter.
